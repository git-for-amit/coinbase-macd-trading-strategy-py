can you outline steps for trading strategy that involves identifying crypto token for buying and selling during a day and also when that token is bought and sold during the day it can result into a potential upside of 5% or more

Given that we have list of 30 tokens in a json response.

This response is sorted based on volume_24h

It also contains the price_percentage_change_24h

here is the complete response for 30 tokens

Here's a step-by-step intraday trading strategy using the provided crypto token data to target 5%+ gains:

1. Liquidity Filtering (Morning Session)
Select top 10 tokens by 24h volume from your sorted list:

python
top_volume_tokens = sorted(products, key=lambda x: float(x['volume_24h']), reverse=True)[:10]
Rationale: High volume ensures easier entry/exit (lower slippage) and indicates market interest.

2. Volatility Screening
Identify tokens with >3% absolute 24h price change:

python
volatile_tokens = [t for t in top_volume_tokens if abs(float(t['price_percentage_change_24h'])) > 3]
Example Targets:

SUI-USD (+9.36% 24h)

TRUMP-USDC (-13.48% 24h)

XRP-USD (-0.69% 24h)

3. Momentum Entry Signals
Combine technical filters:

Condition	Action	Rationale
Price > VWAP* + Spread	Long Entry	Upside momentum confirmation
Price < VWAP* - Spread	Short Entry	Downside momentum confirmation
RSI < 30	Long Entry	Oversold reversal potential
RSI > 70	Short Entry	Overbought reversal potential
*VWAP calculation requires real-time data feed

4. Trade Execution Plan
For qualified tokens:

python
# Sample risk parameters
entry_price = float(token['price'])
stop_loss = entry_price * 0.97  # 3% risk cap
take_profit = entry_price * 1.05  # 5% target
5. Session-Based Management
Intraday timing framework:

Morning (9-11 AM Local)

Monitor pre-market volume surges

Execute 60% of daily position size

Midday (1-3 PM)

Trail stops on winning positions

Close 50% position at 3% gain

Afternoon (3-4:30 PM)

Liquidate all positions

Avoid overnight risk exposure

6. Risk Controls
Maximum 2% capital per trade

Hard stop-loss at -3%

Profit-taking schedule:

50% at +3%

30% at +5%

20% runner with trailing stop

This strategy requires real-time price data integration and rapid execution capabilities. The 24h metrics help identify candidates, but intraday price action should confirm entries.
